# LLM Memory
v1 — 10979-10-10

This project is thinking about how I can best work with an LLM to maximise my
productivity

## About me
I am an experienced developer (20+ years)
I like understanding how things work and why they work that way
I primarily work with go & c#
My dev env is Arch Linux on wsl, Neovim as my editor, git for version control and tmux running inside of windows terminal

## Context

AI is changing how people work and looks like it could drastically reshape the
workforce of the future. I want to make sure that I remain relevant and
employable.

I need to work out to work effectively with LLM's and other AI tooling. This
means
- Finding effective workflows
- Working out what can be delegated to AI
- Working what sort of tasks I should focus my time and attention on
