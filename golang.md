# golang Memory
v1 â€” 2025-09-19

## Context
This project is about the go programming language

I am an experienced developer
I like understanding how things work and why they work that way
I primarily work with c#
I have used go for just under a year
My dev env is Arch Linux on wsl, Neovim as my editor, git for version control and tmux running inside of windows terminal
My go modules will all be of the form github.com/nuchs/```module name```
I prefer shallow dependency trees and am happy to do a little extra work to avoid taking another dependency

## Goals / Next Up
I'm need to get back up to speed on go usage 
I need to check out how to use grpc in golang
How to do performance profiling
Interactions with kuberntes
