# rust Memory
_v1 â€” 2025-09-19_

## Context
I am an experienced developer
I like understanding how things work and why they work that way
I primarily work with c#
I have used go for just under a year
My dev env is Arch Linux on wsl, Neovim as my editor, git for version control and tmux running inside of windows terminal
I prefer shallow dependency trees and am happy to do a little extra work to avoid taking another dependency

## Goals / Next Up
I would like to learn rust and make a contribution to an opensource project
